Build a “Spotify Wrapped” style web app that presents a Project Wrapped for:

Project: DVOI – DaVinci On Iris  
Context: We are finishing version 1.0 and want a fun, visual summary of the work.

Requirements:

1. General
- Single page web app using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks).
- Responsive for desktop and mobile.
- Visual vibe similar to Spotify Wrapped: bold typography, gradients, cards, smooth animations.
- Dark background with vibrant accent colors.

2. Data (placeholders only, ready to be replaced later)
For now use only placeholder data.  
Later this will be replaced by Azure DevOps or Git integration, or manual JSON input.

Include:
- Project name
- Date range (project longer than one year)
- Version info (for example: 1.0)

Example placeholder structure:

const projectWrappedData = {
  projectName: "DVOI – DaVinci On Iris",
  version: "1.0",
  dateRange: {
    start: "2023-01-01",   // placeholder
    end: "2025-12-31"      // placeholder
  },

  stats: {
    totalCommits: 0,
    totalPullRequests: 0,
    totalReviews: 0,
    totalComments: 0,
    totalBugsFixed: 0,
    totalStoryPointsDone: 0,
    sprintsCompleted: 0
  },

  contributors: [
    {
      name: "Contributor 1",
      commits: 0,
      pullRequestsOpened: 0,
      pullRequestsReviewed: 0,
      commentsWritten: 0,
      bugsFixed: 0,
      storyPointsDone: 0
    },
    {
      name: "Contributor 2",
      commits: 0,
      pullRequestsOpened: 0,
      pullRequestsReviewed: 0,
      commentsWritten: 0,
      bugsFixed: 0,
      storyPointsDone: 0
    }
  ],

  // Can be modules, areas, or components
  modules: [
    {
      name: "Module A",
      commits: 0,
      pullRequests: 0,
      storyPointsDone: 0,
      status: "Unknown"
    }
  ],

  // Top 5 lists of interesting data (all placeholder)
  top5: {
    mostCommits: [
      { name: "Dev A", commits: 0 },
      { name: "Dev B", commits: 0 }
    ],
    mostPullRequestsOpened: [
      { name: "Dev C", pullRequestsOpened: 0 }
    ],
    mostPullRequestsReviewed: [
      { name: "Dev D", pullRequestsReviewed: 0 }
    ],
    mostCommentsWritten: [
      { name: "Dev E", commentsWritten: 0 }
    ],
    busiestDaysByCommits: [
      { date: "2025-01-01", commits: 0 }
    ]
  },

  highlights: [
    "Placeholder highlight 1",
    "Placeholder highlight 2"
  ]
};

Create a loadData() function that currently just returns projectWrappedData but is clearly the place to plug:
- Azure DevOps or Git APIs
- Manual JSON
- Any future backend

3. App structure (slides like Spotify Wrapped)

Design the UI as a sequence of slides or sections.

1) Intro slide
- Title: "Project Wrapped"
- Subtitle: "DVOI – DaVinci On Iris 1.0"
- Show date range: "From START to END"
- Short text: "A look back at what it took to ship 1.0"

2) Global statistics slide
- Big number cards for:
  - Total commits
  - Total pull requests
  - Total reviews
  - Total comments
  - Sprints completed
  - Story points done
- Numbers should animate counting up.

3) Champions slide
- Pull Request Reviewer Champion
  - Highlight the contributor with the most pullRequestsReviewed.
  - Big hero card with their name and stats.
- Comments Champion
  - Highlight the contributor with the most commentsWritten.
  - Separate card calling them "Comments Champion".
- Optionally show "Commit Champion" or "Bug Slayer" based on commits and bugsFixed.

4) Top 5 slide
- Use the top5 placeholder data to show:
  - Top 5 by commits
  - Top 5 by pull requests opened
  - Top 5 by reviews
  - Top 5 by comments
- Display in a fun ranking layout (1 to 5) with small badges like "Commit machine", "Review beast".

5) Modules slide
- Cards for each module with:
  - Name
  - Commits
  - Pull requests
  - Story points done
  - Status
- Highlight the module with the most activity as "Most active module".

6) Timeline slide
- Show the journey to 1.0 using the date range and sprintsCompleted.
- Simple timeline with placeholder milestones like:
  - Project kick off
  - First prototype
  - First release candidate
  - Big refactor phase
  - 1.0 freeze
  - 1.0 release
- All milestone text can be placeholder text, but structured in the code.

7) Highlights slide
- Show the highlights array as "Achievements unlocked".
- Each highlight with emojis or icons (for example: rocket, bug, fire).

8) Outro slide
- Message like:
  - "That was DVOI 1.0."
  - "Thanks for all the commits, reviews and comments."
- Placeholder button: "Share this (coming soon)".

4. Visual and UX details
- Smooth scrolling or slide style navigation between sections.
- Use CSS animations:
  - Fade in and slide in for cards.
  - Count up animation for numbers.
- Fun, slightly playful tone. Use emojis and badges for champions and top 5s.
- Keep layout clean and readable.

5. Code structure
- Use three files:
  - index.html
  - styles.css
  - script.js
- In script.js:
  - Put projectWrappedData placeholder object in one place.
  - Implement loadData() that returns the placeholder.
  - Helper functions:
    - renderIntro()
    - renderGlobalStats()
    - renderChampions()
    - renderTop5()
    - renderModules()
    - renderTimeline()
    - renderHighlights()
    - renderOutro()
    - helper for animated counters

6. Comments
Add short clear comments explaining:
- Where to edit the placeholder data.
- Where to integrate Azure DevOps or Git APIs.
- Which functions to change when wiring real data.

Please output a complete working project with:
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js
that I can run directly in the browser.
